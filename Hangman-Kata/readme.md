# Hangman

Create a hangman game with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

You can find an example implementation here: https://coding-katas.netlify.app/hangman/

## Requirements

- Choose a random word out of 10 given words (use 10 words that you learned in the bootcamp or that are coding related)
- Each letter can only be picked once
- Picked letters are disabled on the displayed keyboard
- Add a "New Game" button that will pick a new word and resets the failed attempts
- If you have 10 failes (failed attempts picking a letter) the game is over
